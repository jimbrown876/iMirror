## Why this exists

**Many Android TVs and smart TVs do not come with AirPlay built in.** Depending on
the brand, the built-in feature might be called *AirPlay*, *AirScreen*,
*Air Mirror*, *Screen Mirroring*, *Smart View*, or *Miracast* — and on a lot of
budget or regional TV models it is missing entirely, broken, or locked behind a
paid app full of adverts.

iMirror solves that. It is an **AirPlay receiver you install as an APK on your
Android TV**, which makes the TV appear in the native Screen Mirroring menu on
your iPhone, iPad, or Mac. You then mirror your screen exactly as you would to an
Apple TV — no extra app on the phone, no account, no cable.

## Features

| | |
|---|---|
| 📱 **iPhone & iPad screen mirroring** | Appears natively in iOS Control Centre → Screen Mirroring |
| 💻 **MacBook screen mirroring** | Same AirPlay protocol; works from macOS Control Centre |
| 🔊 **Audio** | AAC-ELD, AAC-LC and ALAC, with independent A/V start and stop |
| ▶️ **Video streaming** | YouTube, Photos and other apps that push a stream URL, with play/pause/scrub |
| 🖼️ **Photos** | Full-screen images sent from the iOS Photos app |
| ⚡ **Low latency** | Hardware H.264 decode straight to the surface, tuned for interactive use |
| 🔒 **Optional PIN pairing** | Off by default; turn it on to stop neighbours connecting |
| 🎮 **TV remote control** | DACP reverse remote — the TV remote drives playback on your phone |

## No ads, no subscription, no catch

There is no paid tier, no watermark, no resolution cap, and no "upgrade to
1080p" prompt. The app contains **no billing, advertising, tracking, or analytics
code whatsoever**, and it never asks for your location. It is GPL-3.0 open source
— read the code and verify that yourself.

## Download

Prebuilt, release-signed APKs are committed in **[`apk/`](apk/)** — no build required.

| Your device | Download |
|---|---|
| Most Android TV boxes & sticks, Fire TV | [`armeabi-v7a`](apk/armeabi-v7a/) |
| Newer 4K Android TV / Google TV | [`arm64-v8a`](apk/arm64-v8a/) |
| Intel-based TVs, ChromeOS, emulators | [`x86`](apk/x86/) · [`x86_64`](apk/x86_64/) |
| **Not sure? Use this one** | [**`universal`**](apk/universal/) — works on everything |

Pick `universal` if you don't know your TV's CPU. See [`apk/README.md`](apk/README.md)
for how to check.

## Install on Android TV

Enable **Developer options → USB debugging** on the TV, then from a computer:

```sh
adb connect <your-tv-ip>
adb install -r iMirror-1.0.0-universal.apk
```

No computer? Use a sideloading app such as *Downloader* or *Send Files to TV* to
copy the APK to the TV and open it there.

## How to mirror

Open iMirror on the TV and leave it on the waiting screen. Then:

**From iPhone or iPad** — swipe into Control Centre → **Screen Mirroring** → pick your TV.

**From a MacBook or iMac** — Control Centre → **Screen Mirroring** → pick your TV.

</div>

The TV shows up under whatever name you set in Settings, alongside real Apple
devices. Nothing to install on the phone or Mac.

> Your phone and TV must be on the **same Wi-Fi network**. If a Mac session drops
> after a few seconds, turn off *Mirror audio* in Settings — macOS drives realtime
> audio clock sync harder than iOS does, and the audio path is the less mature
> half of the stack.

## Supported devices

- **Android TV / Google TV** — Android 7.1 (API 25) and newer
- **Amazon Fire TV** — sticks and cubes
- **Phones and tablets** — the same APK installs and runs, handy for testing

Senders: **iPhone**, **iPad**, and **Mac** running macOS 12 or newer.

## Known limitations

- **Netflix, Disney+, Apple TV+ will not mirror.** Apple's FairPlay DRM protects
  these on every AirPlay path. No open-source receiver can decrypt them — this is
  not a bug and cannot be fixed.
- **Apple Music in-app audio** is protected the same way. Route your Mac's system
  audio output instead, which works.
- **Same network required.** Apple TV can accept connections off-network via
  Apple's AWDL protocol; Android hardware cannot do AWDL.
- **H.264 only** — HEVC is not implemented yet.
- If your **router has AP isolation or multicast filtering** enabled, the TV will
  not appear in the AirPlay menu at all. mDNS discovery needs multicast.

## Build from source

Requires JDK 17+, and an Android SDK with NDK `28.2.13676358` and CMake 3.22.1.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/prat3ik/iMirror.git
cd iMirror
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

For a signed release build, supply your own keystore via `KEYSTORE_PATH`,
`KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`, `KEY_ALIAS` and `KEY_PASSWORD`.

## How it works

The app advertises `_airplay._tcp` and `_raop._tcp` over mDNS, presenting itself
as an Apple TV so senders select the mirroring protocol. Encrypted H.264 arrives
over TCP and is decoded by `MediaCodec` directly onto a `SurfaceView` with no
intermediate copy.

> **Contributor note:** the two mDNS registrations **must** stay serialized.
> Android's `NsdManager` cannot hold two registrations in flight — the second
> silently cancels the first and *neither* callback fires. The failure is
> invisible in logs and leaves the TV undiscoverable to iOS.
